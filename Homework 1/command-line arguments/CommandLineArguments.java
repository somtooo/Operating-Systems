/*
   A simple demonstration of using command line arguments.

   args is an array of String and it holds the strings from
   the command line that started the program. The strings are
   contained in args in the order in which they appeared on
   the command line reading the command line from left to right.
   (Note: Unlike in C or C++, the first argument, args[0], is
          NOT the name of the program.)

   The strings on the command line are considered as "arguments"
   for the program (analogous to "arguments" for a function call).
   Hence the name args, which is an abbreviation of "arguments".

   Be sure to try examples like
     java CommandLineArguments  a b "c d"
     java CommandLineArguments  *
     java CommandLineArguments  *.java

{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      System.out.println("There were " + args.length + " command line arguments.");
      System.out.println("They are:");

      // walk the args array printing out each string.
      for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++)
      {
         System.out.println( args[i] );
      }
   }//main()
